# Twitter-demo

This app demostrates how to use several modern nodejs projects to quickly prototype a simple web application.

### TODO
There is so much that needs to be done that is not even funny :)

- better angularjs routing. There is no need to refresh the whole hero-unit whenever there is a route change

- At the right and left bar, the city and country counter should display the number of tweets per second from that particular location, this feature is currently not implemented.

- To keep the complexty low, currently all the interaction with Redis is done from within nodejs. However, to implement it in Lua and have this Lua script being run within Redis itself would improve performance and allow to better database management.

- Change the icons at the navbar to a more descriptive one.

- Add to new icons at the navbar. A preferences and a about icon.
