# Twitter-demo

This app demostrates how to use several modern nodejs projects to quickly prototype a simple web application.

### TODO
There is so much that needs to be done that is not even funny :)

- [better angularjs routing. There is no need to refresh the whole hero-unit whenever there is a route change]
- [at the right and left bar, the city and country counter should display the number of tweets from that particular location, this feature is currently not implemented]
